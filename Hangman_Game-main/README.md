# Hangman Game

This is a text-based Hangman game implemented in Python.

## Overview

In this project, I implemented a text-based Hangman game where players can guess letters to uncover a randomly selected word from a list. The game provides a limit of 5 incorrect guesses, adding a challenge to guess the word before time runs out!

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.
4. Follow the prompts to guess letters and uncover the word.

## Usage

python main.py
