Text-Based Chatbot with NLTK

Welcome to the Text-Based Chatbot project! This project implements a simple text-based chatbot using Python and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit). The chatbot engages in conversations with users, providing responses based on their input.

**Features**

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes NLTK for basic natural language processing tasks such as tokenization.

Response Generation: Provides responses based on predefined patterns and keywords.

Greeting Detection: Recognizes greetings from users and responds accordingly.

Customizable Responses: Responses are stored in a dictionary, making it easy to customize or extend the chatbot's capabilities.

**Usage**

Run the BasicChatbot.py script:

python BasicChatbot.py

Interact with the chatbot by typing messages in the console. You can start a conversation by greeting the chatbot or asking questions.
